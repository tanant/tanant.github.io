## a summary of NaN/inf maths i ran through

Note: I may not have this 100% right, please use your judgement and *verify* anything that seems off or even seems logical. 

### the basics

- 1/0 = inf  --> large numbers
- 0/0 = nan  --> nonsensical numbers ('penguin')

### nan maths

|what you try  | what you get| (& why) |
 --- | --- | ---
|nan and anything| nan| if it invovles a nan, it'll be a nan.|

### inf maths

|what you try  | what you get | (& why) |
 --- | --- | ---
|inf + 1 | inf | big + 1 is still big|
|inf - 1 | inf | big - 1 is still big|
|inf + inf| inf| yep. Still big|
|-inf - inf| -inf| yep. Still big. but negative|
|inf - inf| **nan** |If the first inf was bigger, this would be positive. If the second inf was bigger, it'd be negative.  (ノ°Д°)ノ︵ ┻━━┻ |
|inf * -1 | -inf | sure, let's flip it to be negative. This is fine. |
|3 * inf | inf | this is (inf + inf + inf) which is (inf + inf) which is (inf) and well, you get the idea|
|inf * 3 | inf | this is the same as above, multiplication doesn't mind the order|
|inf * inf | inf | this is the same as above, just taken to (har har) infinity |
|inf * -inf | -inf | this is basically (inf * inf * -1) which is (inf * -1)|
|1 / inf | **0** | anything divided by a huge amount approximates zero...|
|inf / 2 | inf | half of infinity is still kinda large |
|inf / 0| inf | and anything divided by zero is also going to be huuuge |
|inf * 0| nan | ...but zero lots of infinity is.. weird (see: limit maths) |
|inf * inf| nan | and an infinite amount of infinity is.. weird |
