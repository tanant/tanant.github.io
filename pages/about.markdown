# Hi, my name's Anthony! *(waves)*

I appear to generate enough silly bits and pieces of material that _some_ people find useful, so instead of locking it down to the inside of my head and whatever random text files I've got kicking around, I could probably put this online.

Right now, as with everything, this is one giant tech test. The idea is to do what I can as badly as possible in a way that _just_ squeaks over the line, which in turn makes me figure out what I next need to do to get to the next stage. 

## Where's Anthony (as at June 2020)?

Montréal.

## What's he doing right now (as at June 2020)?

Wrangling the 2D/Compositing pipeline at DNEG Montréal. 

Developing bits of it in conjunction with the RnD 2D team, acting as frontline support where needed, training the juniors, trying to set a general vision of where our pipeline should head both in terms of tools and tone, plus as well doing misc pipeline-y stuff that hopefully noone will ever notice (because if you notice it, I broke it..)

## How'd he get here?

After a slightly long and torturous route winding through:
 - a split Engineering and Commerce degree in Perth
    (the hot one in Australia, not the colder one in Scotland);
 - bashing numbers with the Australian Federal Government on a couple of budgets (no, really);
 - 'acting' in London;
 - relocating to Sydney and somehow fluking a job on Fury Road;

...I've somehow managed to have been gainfully employed in this VFX industry for like, a decade now.
