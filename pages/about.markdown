# Hi, my name's Anthony! *(waves)*

I appear to generate enough silly bits and pieces of material that _some_ people find useful, so instead of locking it down to the inside of my head and whatever random text files I've got kicking around, I could probably put this online.

Right now, as with everything, this is one giant tech test. The idea is to do what I can as badly as possible in a way that _just_ squeaks over the line, which in turn makes me figure out what I next need to do to get to the next stage. 

## Where's Anthony (as at ~~2021~~2024)?

Montréal.

## What's he doing right now?

Oof, big shifts (you can check from commit e31b13c for a historical) - in the intervening time I've started a move from 2D/Comp pipeline to Product Manager through to being involved in the annoying instability that is M&E right now. 

Currently I'm working on a short film, learning new tech, keeping eye out for decent production-style roles, doing miscallaneous photography things for my friends in the wheeled sports scene and of note (for me), je aussi parle français finallement.. pas au niveau trés éléve mais je le fais! 

## Anything else?

I'm part of the [Visual Effects Society](https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/), currently the Treasurer for the Montreal section.

## How'd you get here?

After a slightly long and torturous route winding through:
 - a split Engineering and Commerce degree in Perth
    (the hot one in Australia, not the colder one in Scotland);
 - bashing numbers with the Australian Federal Government on a couple of budgets (no, really);
 - 'acting' in London;
 - relocating to Sydney and somehow fluking a job on Fury Road.
